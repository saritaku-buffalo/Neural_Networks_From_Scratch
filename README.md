# Neural_Networks_From_Scratch
Building a Simple Neural Network from Scratch

# The architecture structure of the provided neural network is as follows:
• Input layer: the input layer has 7 nodes (the number of features in the dataset).
• Hidden layer 1: the first hidden layer has 128 nodes and uses the ReLU activation
function.
• Hidden layer 2: the second hidden layer also has 128 nodes and uses the ReLU
activation function.
• Output layer: the output layer has 1 node (for binary classification) and uses the Sigmoid
activation function.
